- Give detailed indications on how to compile and run the project from the command line.

	Compile all class of project with the command Javac.
		
	Go to src folder and Execute the main of project with the command line :
		
		java nolspotlex.v1.Main
	

-Answer the question: what is the difference between the withenums.v1 andwithenums.v2 versions? 
Which is better and why?

	The String of commands are constants and depend on the language player.
	In the v1, the constants ("GO", "HELP") are put into the CommandWords class in the constructor 
	of object whereas in the v2 they are put in the CommandWord enum.
	By convention it's better putting the constants in a enum than a class.
